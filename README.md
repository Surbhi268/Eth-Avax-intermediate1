# Eth-Avax-Intermediate Assessment1 - Getting started with error handling.
In this project , I am adding error handling methods of solidity in creating smart contract as mentioned in project given.
## Description
Here this Solidity contract named errorHandlingProject is a simple Solidity smart contract demonstrating the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The contract includes basic functionality to Add and Buy a car in showroom.
### Code execution
For executing the code i have used remix ide [https://remix.ethereum.org/].

### Code Explanation
The errorHandlingProject is a basic Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for ensuring contract correctness and handling errors. This code defines a smart contract for a car showroom on the blockchain. It allows users to add cars with unique IDs, brands, models, and prices. Users can also buy these cars if they have sufficient funds and the car exists. The contract ensures car ownership is transferred securely and prevents buying your own car.
