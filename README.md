# Eth-Avax-Intermediate Assessment1 - Getting started with error handling.
In this project , I am adding error handling methods of solidity in creating smart contract as mentioned in project given.
## Description
Here this Solidity contract named errorHandlingProject is a simple Solidity smart contract demonstrating the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements. The contract includes basic functionality to set, square, and reset a number.
### Code execution
For executing the code i have used remix ide [https://remix.ethereum.org/].

### Code Explanation
The errorHandlingProject is a basic Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for ensuring contract correctness and handling errors. It includes three main functions: setNumber(), which sets a number (greater than zero); square(), which squares the current number and uses assert() to ensure the new value is logically consistent; and reset(), which resets the number to zero and uses revert() to prevent the operation if the value is already zero. This contract serves as a straightforward example of how these statements can be used to enforce conditions and handle errors in Solidity.

=> Must check whether the compiler version set according to your code.

=> Now go to deploy and transact section for giving inputs and click on transact after adding inputs the account.

=> After this your deployed contracts will be at the bottom.
